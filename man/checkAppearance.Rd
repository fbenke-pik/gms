\usage{
checkAppearance(x, capitalExclusionList = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A code list as returned by \code{\link{codeExtract}}}

\item{capitalExclusionList}{A vector of names that should be ignored when
checking for unified capitalization of variables}
}
\value{
A list with four elements: appearance, setappearance, type and
warnings. Appearance is a matrix containing values which indicate whether an
object appears in a part of the code or not (e.g. indicates whether "vm_example"
appears in realization "on" of module "test" or not.). 0 means that it does not appear,
1 means that it appears in the code and 2 means that it appears in the
not_used.txt. setappearance contains the same information but for sets instead of other
objects. Type is a vector containing the type of each object (exluding sets). And warnings
contains a list of warnings created during that process.
}
\description{
Checks for all declared objects in which parts of the model they appear and
calculates the type of each object (core object, interface object, module
object of module xy,...)
